Summary: Interview questions I've been asked for software positions.

## Every Interview Question I Can Remember

Here's a list of questions I've gotten in applying for software engineering jobs since college, in no particular order.

* A fellow engineer has asked you to review some code. Identify any possible errors, if they exist (10 question multiple choice).
* Bash questions about how to find file names, how to find contents of files
* Calculate the degree between the angle of the hands on a clock given the time.
* Can you apply const modifier to a function?
* Can you manipulate a member variable of a class from a const function?
* Design a protocol over UART. How would you send binary data over this (text based) protocol? Implement base64 encoding.
* Design system to control a pwm-based component
* Find an element in a sorted array.
* Fix some (contrived) bugs in the current codebase.
* Give a presentation on a specified topic to 15 people
* Given a graph, in which vecticies are frogs, and edges are parent/child relationships, determine if two frogs have a common ancestor.
* Given an array of integers, find an index (if it exists) in which the sum of all integers on the left of the index and the sum of all integers on the right of the index are equal.
* How do virtual functions work?
* How to atomically write a register or non-volatile memory?
* How would you store 1.5 in a 16 bit system with no floating point unit?
* I pulled this code from the standard library. What does it do? (strtok)
* Implement a doubly-linked list. Insert an element, and delete an element. Is it thread safe?
* Implement a function to return the nth number of the fibonacci sequence
* Implement a spell checker in C.
* Implement a class "BigInt" for working with integers of arbitrary precision, as well as some functions supporting basic mathematical operations (add, subtract, etc).
* Implement strcpy
* Implement memcpy
* Implement read, write, ioctl for a GPS device driver in linux
* Name data structures you know and their properties?
* Print out a tree in level-order, one line per level.
* Reverse a string using the following function signatures: `void reverse(char *str)` and `char* reverse(const char *str)`
* Set a bit, clear a bit
* Set a bit, clear a bit, set a mask in a register
* Tell me about a software project you worked on that you are most proud of?
* What are the 4 types of casts in C++?
* What does the register keyword do?
* What does the volatile keyword do?
* What does the volatile keyword do?
* What does this code do? Bugs? Improvements? (shuffled 1000 ints from 0-999)
* What features would you include in an RPC framework?
* What is /dev and /etc ?
* What is a friend function and how do you implement it?
* What is a virtual function?
* What is the alignment of a class?
* What is the big O of a "decent" sorting algorithm
* What is the const modifier?
* What is the difference between a reference variable and a pointer?
* Why do we have virtual functions?
* Write a function to print out all permutations of a string.
