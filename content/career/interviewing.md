Summary: Interviewing is hard.

I left my startup in February, and I learned a lot while I was there. In fact it wasn't until I started interviewing that I realized how much I'd learned and improved my skillset.

But wow, interviewing is hard. There are so many ways to go about doing it, but at the end of the day it always seems to come down to which way are the winds blowing today.

Here are some lessons I've learned so far.

## Lesson 1: Have a Backup Plan

The first company I tried to interview with I spent a couple of months building a relationship with one of the engineers there. He was (and is) a well-respected and accomplished engineer, and I was lucky to have gotten an introduction with him. He introduced me to the hiring manager at his company, and eventually I went into the interview process.

I struggled a little bit with the questions there, but ultimately I felt that I did alright and that they'd see the potential within me. However, they decided not to continue interviews and that was that.

I spent two months on that company alone, without pursuing any other company during that time. I practically envisioned myself as an employee there for a month before the interview.

After two months sunk, and no other leads, it was back to square 0.

## Lesson 2: Exploding Offers are Bullshit

I started applying to several companies, and one got back to me pretty quickly. I interviewed there, and within a month found myself with an offer. Except that the offer expired in 2 days from the day I received it.

I wasn't sold, and I wasn't going to give them a yes due to artificial pressure. When I'm making a significant decision like taking a new job, a decision that I'm going to sink some year(s) of my life into, I want it to be a decision that I have come to my own conclusions about.

I could have asked for more time, but I felt like they were trying to trap me, and it didn't feel good.

## Lesson 3: Empathy / Forgiveness is Critical

Interviewing people and being interviewed are both hectic processes, and it doesn't always run smoothly.

One company I interviewed with directed me to the wrong location for the interview -- as in the wrong city. Fortunately I left early enough to figure out this mistake and I still made it to my interview on time. I was annoyed but mostly looked past it.

Later, in talking with other recruiters, a trend started occuring.

They...

* Didn't call at scheduled time
* Didn't call at all
* Didn't follow up with me for days at a time
* Misspelled my name, their own company name, etc

With one person you might think, "ah yeah that's a little rude." They're wasting my time as I'm sitting here at my desk for 30 minutes specifically waiting for them.

But then when it happens 3, 4 times in a row... I developed a very low tolerance for it. In one case, the interviewer called one hour late, and the links to the shared document we were to use for coding were wrong. By the time he asked "is now still a good time?" I had had it.

But it wasn't his fault, and it certainly wasn't intentional. The scheduler or scheduling system made a mistake. And honestly I am the only person who suffered in that process, because my mind was so clouded that I couldn't think straight. Had it been the first time I encounterd this, I would have probably been alright -- but with 2 or 3 experiences preceeding this it felt like the recruiting world was out to get me.

So the big lesson here is: swallow your pride and forgive people for being late, non-responsive, or whatever. Yes, it can be very rude. But it's almost certainly not personal, intentional, or calculated. And you can choose to be angry, but that only changes your own reality. It doesn't fix things, and in fact can harm the situation more than it can help.

## Lesson 4: Be Prepared for No

Twice now I've interviewed with companies that I've been convinced I really, really want to work at. And with one of them, I thought I definitely had it in the bag.

But then the call comes, and all of those visions of you working there on the most exciting projects with the smartest people pop. Back to reality.

Despite multiple referrals or feeling great about the interviews, it just happens. And sucks, but that's how it goes. It's hard to take this lesson and learn from it. I don't find it easy to haphazardly interview with companies that don't excite me, so telling myself to not envison myself working there or not get set on achieving my goal of working there doesn't work. But at the same time, under promise, over deliver... more data is needed on this one.

## Conclusion

Interviewing is hard.
